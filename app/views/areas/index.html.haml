    %article
      %p This collaborative project between FutureGov, Devon Council and Kingston and Sutton Councils was funded by the Cabinet Office with the aim to encourage councils to release more adult social care open data, publish it to data.gov.uk and to demonstrate the benefits of this approach.
  %section.third.home-summary

    %h3 The first phase
    %article
      %p Involved mapping existing data, identifying user needs and exploring what additional adult social care data could be released as open data regularly to data.gov.uk. Below you’ll find links to the data, design tools, a framework and guides for how the councils have released this data that you can reuse.
  %section.third.home-summary
    = image_tag("ProjectSecondPhase.jpg", alt: "The second phase - Building a prototype app using discovered data")
    %h3 The second phase
    %article
      %p Brings together relevant existing adult social care open data (including the data released in this project) into a prototype that demonstrates the benefits that releasing this data might have for council commissioners, providers and the general public.

Our intention is that together with the final report, this provides a framework that can be followed by other councils allowing them to release more data.

      %h3 Local Care Market Demonstrator - Coming soon
  .third
    %p Council’s have an important role to understand and shape their local adult social care market and they have to create a market positioning statement. It’s a full time job to pull together relevant data from different external sources and internal systems, analyse it and keep it up to date.
    %p Our prototype attempts to demonstrate how bringing together open adult social care data can make it easier for councils to quickly understand their local care market and could help create new opportunities for providers and give more choice to users through greater transparency.
    %p Check out some of early sketches and wireframes as the prototype takes shape.
