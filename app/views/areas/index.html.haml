    %h3 Background
    %article
      %p This project was created in a funding challenge set by the Cabinet Office with the aim to help Councils release more adult social care data under the open data license.
  %section.third.home-summary
    %h3 The first phase
    %article
      %p First we focussed on exploring the available data-sets and finding processes to open them up on a regular basis. You can find the relvant materials below.
  %section.third.home-summary
    %h3 The second phase
    %article
      %p Is about bringing together relevant existing adult social care open data, including data released in phase one, to build a prototype that demonstrates some of the benefits that releasing this data might have for council commissioners, providers and the general public.

    To help think about different ways data sets could be used to meet needs we created a card game. Download the game, edit and re-use it to help think about data in different ways.

  .third
    We worked with the councils to create a light-process for sharing data and project documentation. We made use of collaborative tools like Google Drive to share data, making sure access rights were defined and setup at the beginning of the project. Download and re-use our data sharing agreement here.
